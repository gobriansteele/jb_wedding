      jackie: `Brian and I met at work! Good ol' Ameriprise Financial in Minneapolis, MN. In the summer of 2016
        I transitioned to a new role in technology, joining the same team as Brian. I remember knowing 
        when Brian was near my desk because he was always chatting with someone, and I'd hear his boisterous 
        voice intensify across the 5th floor cubicles as he got closer and closer to me. 2016 was the year I
        started to spend more time getting ready for work in the morning.`,
      brian: `I saw Jackie appear on our floor at work and knew right away
      I needed to talk to her. I found whatever reason I could to be over by her desk. 
      I made friends with people in that area. I talked a bit louder-basically, anything I could do to get her attention. 
      I used all my humor, charm and guile. It didn't seem very effective. I remember trying to talk to Jackie once and her 
      looking at me with a bemused expression. Certainly a portent of things to come.`,

      jackie: `Brian and I met for drinks at the Union rooftop bar in downtown Minneapolis. I had just come down with a really 
        bad cough; I was SO sick, I almost canceled! But he got us tickets to a Cirque du Soleil show that was in town at 
        the Target Center, and I had always wanted to see a Cirque du Soleil show - it was on my bucket list! So I took a 
        bunch of medicine and loaded my purse up with one thousand cough drops. It was the Avatar Cirque show which, it turns out, 
        is more of a children's show... lol. Even though I was at the children's theater, sounded like Clint Eastwood when 
        words came out of my mouth, and wasn't able to enjoy any of the drinks because all my taste buds were taken over by Menthol-Lyptus 
        Extra Strength HALLS, I was somehow still having a really great time on this date! I remember laughing a bunch and enjoying 
        our conversations. After we ducked out early of the sesame street play, he took me to a late dinner at 4 Bells in Uptown, 
        where I continued to not taste a single thing, but loved every minute of it.`,
      brian:
        "I was so nervous before our first date. Jackie seemed great and interesting and to top that all off, she is beautiful. Essentially, I went into this date assuming she was way too good for me (an assumption which the subsequent years have proven to be true). I remember buying this really fancy shirt to wear and being incredibly anxious as the date got closer. I had thought of lots of questions to ask her and also had picked out what I thought would be a cool show to go to and a great place to get dinner afterwards. The show, to my dismay, ended up being pretty boring, but the dinner was great! At the end of the night, in my infinite wisdom, I went in for a goodnight kiss and was rebuffed (Jackie had a pretty bad cold). I felt dumb and was certain that this would be our only date ever. For the first of countless times in our relationship-I was wrong.",

    summary: `After much research, we moved to Latitude 45 in downtown Minneapolis. A favorite memory of this place was on Valentines 
      Day 2019 when Jackie came home from work and Brian was riding his bike on the inddor turbo-trainer in the living room. 
      Needless to say, Jackie was not impressed with Brian's wattage output or intensity.`,

    title: "Moved to California",
    date: "July/September 2019",
    summary: `We were extremely tired of Minnesota winters. We had narrowed our choices down to Seattle or San Francisco. We first travelled 
      to Seattle to check it out and we really enjoyed it and thought that would be our destination. However, about 6 weeks later we 
      took a trip to visit our great friends Jim & Jane Geppert in San Francisco, and within 2 days, Jackie had decided that San Francisco was the place.`,

        "On Brian's 40th birthday he surprised ME because he knew I would never see it coming. He was right. He popped the question on top of the scenic Ring Mountain (how fitting a name!), overlooking the Bay, surrounded by my family. I was so happy my mom and dad were there to witness my profanity in person - and my sweet cousin Amy too, who was the sneaky cinematographer.",
      brian:
        "Jackie had done a ton of planning for my 40th birthday. I figured that would be a great opportunity to surprise her with 'the question' as she wouldn't be expecting it. I was able to organize her Mom, Dad, Rob and Amy being out in California with us. A few weeks or so before my birthday, I told Jackie I really wanted a sunset happy hour to celebrate. She was all onboard with the idea and had no idea this was my ruse to get her up to the top of Ring Mountain where I'd propose. With her mom, dad and cousin Amy present, I was able to completely surprise Jackie with my proposal. I knew, based on her R-rated reaction I'd really done a good job of keeping the whole thing under wraps. I was fairly confident she would say 'yes', but I did hedge my bet by asking on my birthday, I figured she couldn't say 'no'.",
