        "Brian and I met at work! Good ol' Ameriprise Financial in Minneapolis, MN. In the summer of 2016 I transitioned to a new role in technology, joining the same team as Brian. I remember always knowing when Brian was near my desk because he was always chatting with someone, and I'd hear his boisterous voice intensify across the 5th floor cubicles as he got closer and closer to me. 2016 was the year I started to spend more time getting ready for work in the morning.",

        "I saw Jackie appear on our floor at work and knew right away I needed to talk to her. I found whatever reason I could to be over by her desk. I made friends with people in that area. I talked a bit louder-basically, anything I could do to get her attention. I used all my humor, charm and guile. It didn't seem very effective. I remember trying to talk to Jackie once and her looking at me with a bemused expression. Certainly a portent of things to come.",

        "Brian and I met for drinks at the Union rooftop bar in downtown Minneapolis. I had just come down with a really bad cough; I was SO sick, I almost canceled! But he got us tickets to a Cirque du Soleil show that was in town at the Target Center, and I had always wanted to see a Cirque du Soleil show - it was on my bucket list! So I took a bunch of medicine and loaded my purse up with one thousand cough drops. It was the Avatar Cirque show which, it turns out, is more of a children's show... lol. Even though I was at the children's theater, sounded like Clint Eastwood when words came out of my mouth, and wasn't able to enjoy any of the drinks because all my taste buds were taken over by Menthol-Lyptus Extra Strength HALLS, I was somehow still having a really great time on this date! I remember laughing a bunch and really enjoying our conversations. After we ducked out early of the sesame street play, he took me to a late dinner at 4 Bells in Uptown, where I continued to not taste a single thing, but loved every minute of it.",

      "After much research, we moved to Latitude 45 in downtown Minneapolis. A favorite memory of this place was on Valentines Day 2019 when Jackie came home from work and Brian was riding his bike on the trainer in the living room. Needless to say, Jackie was not impressed with Brian's wattage output",

    summary:
      'We were extremely tired of Minnesota winters. We had narrowed our choices down to Seattle or San Francisco. We first travelled to Seattle to check it out and we really enjoyed it and thought that would be our destination. However, about 6 weeks later we took a trip to visit our great friends Jim & Jane Geppert in San Francisco, and within 2 days, Jackie had decided that San Francisco was the place.',
