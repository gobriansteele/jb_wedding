        "Brian and I met at work! Good ol' Ameriprise Financial in Minneapolis, MN. In the summer of 2016 I transitioned to a new role in technology, joining the same team as Brian. I remember always knowing when Brian was near my desk because he was always chatting with someone, and I'd hear his boisterous voice intensify across the 5th floor cubicles as he got closer and closer to me. 2016 was the year I started to spend more time getting ready for work in the morning.",
      brian:
        "I saw Jackie appear on our floor at work and knew right away I needed to talk to her. I found whatever reason I could to be over by her desk. I made friends with people in that area. I talked a bit louder-basically, anything I could do to get her attention. I used all my humor, charm and guile. It didn't seem very effective. I remember trying to talk to Jackie once and her looking at me with a bemused expression. Certainly a portent of things to come.",
